Day1 Notes and Documentation  

# What we are going to learn 

* Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables 

* We are making a Band name generator, I made my own revisions to it.

* I used ChatGPT to generate nouns for a Band name and generate adjectives for a band.

* If I type backdoor, then the application will just generate me a completely random name with a noun and adjective. However, if I answer the prompt which is my favorite animal(I think) then it will only generate a random adjective. # FAQ: Can I use pycharm/VScode not really important just talking about using specific IDEs and stuff. i rather just use vim because I'm a chad and I'm going to commit to use this 


# Quick Vim Tricks I tried learning trying to alt tab 

Ctrl-N can allow the file navigator to open
Ctrl-i to alternate between tabs 
not sure how to close specific tabs yet(find that out) 



# Printing to the Console in Python

* lol this lesson is literally just print("test")


# How to enroll for free on AUditorium
* lol i'm going to skip this one 


# 8. Interactive Coding Exercise Printing 
* print modifiers 
print("She said: "Hello" and then left.")
print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')
print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left.") 


# 9. String Manipulation and Code Intelligence 
* regex string manipulation 

print("Hello World!") 
print("Hello World!") 
* or we can do this 
print("Hello World!\nHello World")

* what about printing concatenation 
print("Hello" + " " + "World!")


# 10. [Interactive Coding Exercise] Debugging Practice 
* skipped this because debugging is an art 
* just use print statements to do debugging 


# 11. The Python Input Function
input()
* this effect belows is pretty cool 
print('Hello' + input("What is your name"))


# 12. [Interactive Coding] Input Function 
numOfLetters =  len(input())
print(numOfLetters)


# 13. Python Variables
* no need to specify the data type in python 

* name = input("What is your name")
* print(name) 

# 14. [Interactive Coding Exercise] Variables
example of concatenation of string let's try it 


# 15. Variables Naming
* can name variables like this with multiple words 
    * three_worded_variable = 123 
* however this is illegal
    * 1word 
    * this will return a invalid syntax error

# 15b. Variable Naming Quiz 
* quiz, nothing learned 


# 16. Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator 
* find code in the repository within this folder 
* cool trick 
    * print(f'Variable is {a}')
